        * Makefile: changed in order to accept as argument the main code to use (any .C inside utils/)
        * Configuration file system added
        * util/myFit.config: added
        * util/myFit.C: changed in order to read util/myFit.config
        * Region.C: Option added to have different constrains on Overall and Histo systs (at the moment both have interpCode=4, which seems to perform better - to check)
